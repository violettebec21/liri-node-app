## What LIRI does
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in command parameters and gives you back data.

## Why is LIRI is useful?
LIRI searches Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies. LIRI can help you find information about your favorite songs and artists by utilizing Spotify API data, concert data using BandsInTown API data, and movie data using OMDB API data. 

## How to get started using LIRI
LIRI retrieves data using Node on the command line, so go to your terminal/command line, type in 'Node' then 'liri.js' then one of the following commands: 

   * `concert-this <artist/band name here>`

   * `spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`

   * `movie-this '<movie name here>'`

   * `do-what-it-says`
